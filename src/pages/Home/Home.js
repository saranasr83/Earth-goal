                We figured people use a lot of products, which could be harmful to the environment in so many ways. The main reasons for that could be either a) lack of knowledge about what they are using and the potential negative impact that could have on our earth.  Or b) lack of availability and variety of clean, sustainable, and eco friendly products. So, weâ€™ve decided to make the usage of environmental friendly products easier by providing eco-friendly items in a form of subscription boxes that can be delivered to them every season. People can choose their items from the different categories based on their needs, interests, and budget.
